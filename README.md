# Automatically Generate Spotify Playlist from Youtube Playlist
This Python program automates the creation of a personal Spotify playlist directly from a personal Youtube playlist.  

# Example

The Youtube playlist that I have created looks like this:   
<img src="https://github.com/shhirl/spotify_playlists/blob/main/images/youtube_playlist.jpg" width="700">

After running this Python script, I will see a new Spotify playlist that looks like this
