# Automatically Generate Spotify Playlist from Youtube Playlist
This Python program automates the creation of a personal Spotify playlist directly from a personal Youtube playlist.  

# Example

* The Youtube playlist that I have created is called 'for spotify'. It looks like this on the Youtube website:

* Before running the Python script,  I replace the fields `youtube_playlist_name` and `new_playlist_name` in the file `main.py` with the Youtube playlist name and the new Spotify playlist name I would like to be created respectively. 

* After running the Python script, I will see a new Spotify playlist called 'Youtube Playlist to Spotify'. It looks like this on the Spotify desktop app:
